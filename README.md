# Miracle Ramos ‚Äì Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I‚Äôm a fourth-year Computer Science major with a Data Science minor at Northwestern University, focused on machine learning, analytics, and UI/UX-driven data storytelling. This portfolio collects my academic projects across programming, data science, web development, and analytics.

Each project includes either a rendered report, GitHub repo link, or a YouTube presentation.

## üìà Disney Box Office Analysis ‚Äì STAT 302 (Winter 2025)
**Summary:** I analyze Disney‚Äôs box office history to quantify how the acquisitions of Pixar (2006), Marvel (2009), and Lucasfilm (2012) affected revenue and to compare genre profitability, finding that superhero and animation lead.

**Skills and tools:** R, tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, readr), ggplot2 data visualization, EDA, feature engineering, time-series/grouped summaries, Quarto, Git/GitHub, GitHub Pages.

## üé• Parallelism in Real Life: How Pixar Renders Movies ‚Äì COMP_SCI 358 (Spring 2025)
**Summary:** A fast, visual overview of how Pixar renders films using parallel computing, splitting frames and shots across many CPU and GPU cores, scheduling workloads, and recombining results into movie-quality images.

**Skills and tools:** Parallel computing concepts (task/data parallelism, scheduling), GPU vs. CPU architecture overview, research synthesis, technical communication, slide design.

## üìä Data Science Year-Long Sequence

### Final Project 1 ‚Äì STAT 301-1 (Fall 2024)
**Summary:** I analyzed U.S. college salary outcomes by cleaning and joining WSJ/Kaggle and College Scorecard data, converting privacy-suppressed values, engineering ROI and 1‚Äì3 year earnings growth metrics, and communicating insights with clear ggplot2 visualizations and summary tables. The report is fully reproducible in Quarto and version-controlled with Git and GitHub Pages.

**Skills and tools:** R, tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, readr), ggplot2, data cleaning, joins, feature engineering, EDA, descriptive statistics, Quarto, Git, GitHub Pages.

### Final Project 2 ‚Äì STAT 301-2 (Winter 2025)
**Summary:** Built a supervised machine learning pipeline with tidymodels to compare regularized linear models (lasso, elastic net) and tree-based methods (random forest, boosted trees). I framed the problem and evaluation criteria, performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, interpreted variable importance, and designed reader-friendly visuals and layout with UI/UX principles to communicate findings clearly.

**Skills and tools:** Machine learning (supervised learning), model comparison, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, model interpretability (variable importance), data visualization (ggplot2), Quarto report design with UI/UX considerations, research framing/literature scan, R, tidymodels (recipes, workflows, parsnip, tune, yardstick), Git/GitHub (incl. Git LFS), GitHub Pages.

## üåê Northwestern Navigator ‚Äì COMP_SCI 396 (Summer 2024)
**Summary:** A responsive informational site for incoming Northwestern students that organizes key resources and tips into clear, easy-to-navigate pages.  

**Skills and tools:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, UI/UX design (wireframing, information architecture, content strategy), React, accessibility/semantic markup, content organization, Git/GitHub, GitHub Pages.
